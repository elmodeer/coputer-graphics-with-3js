NOTE: If you load models or textures from external files, due to browsers' same origin policy security restrictions, loading from a file system will fail with a security exception.

so run files from a local web server. This allows you to access your page as:
http://localhost/yourFile.html

to run a loacl server with node.js. just run "http-server . -p 8000" in your terminal.
